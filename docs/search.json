To better understand the quantum hardness of LWE, it is crucial to explore quantum variants of LWE. To this end, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry [Eurocrypt 2022] defined \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{C\\ket{LWE}}\\) problems by encoding the error of LWE samples into quantum amplitudes, and showed efficient quantum algorithms for a few interesting amplitudes. However, algorithms or hardness results of the most interesting amplitude, Gaussian, were not addressed before.\nIn this paper, we show new algorithms, hardness results and applications for \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\) with real Gaussian, Gaussian with linear or quadratic phase terms, and other related amplitudes. Let \\(n\\) be the dimension, \\(q\\) be the modulus of LWE samples. Our main results are\n\nThere is a \\(2^{\\Theta(\\sqrt{n\\log(q)})}\\)-time algorithm for \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\) with Gaussian amplitude with known phase, given \\(2^{\\Theta(\\sqrt{n\\log(q)})}\\) many quantum samples. The algorithm is modified from Kuperberg’s sieve, and in fact works for more general amplitudes as long as the amplitudes and phases are completely known.\nThere is a polynomial time quantum algorithm for solving \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\) and \\(\\mathsf{C\\ket{LWE}}\\) for Gaussian with quadratic phase amplitudes, where the sample complexity is as small as \\(\\tilde{O}(n)\\). As an application, we give a quantum oblivious LWE sampler where the core quantum sampler requires only quasi-linear sample complexity. This improves upon the previous oblivious LWE sampler given by Debris-Alazard, Fallahpour, Stehlé [STOC 2024], whose core quantum sampler requires \\(\\tilde{O}(nr)\\) sample complexity, where r is the standard deviation of the error.\nThere exist polynomial time quantum reductions from standard LWE or worst-case GapSVP to \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\) with Gaussian amplitude with small unknown phase, and arbitrarily many samples. Compared to the first two items, the appearance of the unknown phase term places a barrier in designing efficient quantum algorithm for solving standard LWE via \\(\\mathsf{S\\ket{LWE}}\\)."

However, their applications in cryptography, which serves as a foundational pillar of cybersecurity, remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we propose AICrypto, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the cryptographic capabilities of LLMs. The benchmark comprises 135 multiple-choice questions, 150 capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges, and 18 proof problems, covering a broad range of skills from factual memorization to vulnerability exploitation and formal reasoning. All tasks are carefully reviewed or constructed by cryptography experts to ensure correctness and rigor. To support automated evaluation of CTF challenges, we design an agent-based framework. To gain deeper insight into the current state of cryptographic proficiency in LLMs, we introduce human expert performance baselines for comparison across all task types. Our evaluation of 17 leading LLMs reveals that state-of-the-art models match or even surpass human experts in memorizing cryptographic concepts, exploiting common vulnerabilities, and routine proofs. However, they still lack a deep understanding of abstract mathematical concepts and struggle with tasks that require multi-step reasoning and dynamic analysis. We hope this work could provide insights for future research on LLMs in cryptographic applications. Our code and dataset are available at https://aicryptobench.github.io."
