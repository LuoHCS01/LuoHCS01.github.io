::: {#hero-heading}

I have a deep passion for classical music, and have focused on piano practice under the guidance of Professor Chun Wu, a Steinway Artist at the Central Conservatory of Music. I have performed numerous classical masterpieces on stage at Tsinghua University and gained extensive performance experience. Welcome to follow my [Bilibili channel](https://space.bilibili.com/426164965).

我热爱古典音乐，并在中央音乐学院教授、施坦威艺术家吴纯老师的指导下专注于钢琴演奏的练习。我曾多次在清华登台演出，演奏过许多经典曲目，有丰富的舞台经验。欢迎关注我的[B站账号](https://space.bilibili.com/426164965)。
